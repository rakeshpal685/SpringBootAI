The <modules> section in the parent pom.xml is used to define a multi-module Maven project, also known as a Maven aggregator project. It helps manage multiple sub-projects (modules) under a single parent structure.
ðŸ”¹ How it Works:
- The parent POM acts as the central controller, managing dependencies, build configurations, and versioning.
- The listed <module> entries (like product-service, order-service, and payment-service) correspond to submodules, which are individual Maven projects stored in separate directories within the parent project.
- When you execute a Maven command (e.g., mvn clean install) from the parent directory, it automatically builds all listed modules together.
  ðŸ”¹ Why Use It?
  âœ” Centralized Dependency Management: The parent POM can define common dependencies, reducing redundancy across modules.
  âœ” Unified Build & Deployment: All modules can be compiled, tested, and packaged together efficiently.
  âœ” Consistent Versioning: Helps synchronize versions across multiple microservices or components.
  âœ” Modular Development: Supports microservices architecture, where different services can have their own lifecycle but remain under one project umbrella.

--------------------------------
Parent <dependencyManagement>: Declares the available dependencies and their versions for the entire project.
Child <dependencies>: Declares the required dependencies for that specific module.
The child's declaration in <dependencies> tells Maven, "I need this library," and the parent's <dependencyManagement> tells Maven, "When you need this library, use this specific version (unless the child overrides it)."
This pattern ensures that you have centralized version control while still allowing each module to define its specific dependencies.
